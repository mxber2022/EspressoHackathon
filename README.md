# Verifiable AI Rollup 🧠⛓️

*A scalable rollup for executing and verifying AI/ML inferences onchain using ZK proofs.*

## Overview

Verifiable AI Rollup is blockchain solution that enables trustless execution and verification of AI/ML models on Ethereum L3 powered by espresso confimation.

### Key Features
- 🛠️ **Support for ZK and Optimistic Rollups**: Choose between zk-SNARK/STARK proofs or fraud-proof-based verification.
- 🤖 **AI Framework Integration**: Run PyTorch, TensorFlow, or ONNX models in a zkVM or WASM runtime.
- 🔍 **On-Chain Verification**: Verify proofs via smart contracts.
- 🏗️ **Decentralized Provers**: Permissionless network for proof generation.
